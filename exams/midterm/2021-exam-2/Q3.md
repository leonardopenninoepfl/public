# Question 3: New features [15 points]

Your team is considering adding support for the SwengPhotos cloud service,
which provides upload and download of photos on private cloud storage.
Each photo is associated with a unique name.

SwengPhotos's documentation for the "upload new photo" interface describes the following error responses:

1. I/O error
2. Backend timeout error
3. Name already exists error

Explain, in 1-3 sentences, which of these errors are abstraction leaks and why:

> ???

You decide to build a Java library to wrap the SwengPhotos API.
For each error, explain in 1 sentence whether it should be a "checked" exception and why:

1. I/O: ???

2. Backend timeout: ???

3. Name already exists: ???

_You get 6 points for correctly identifying which of the errors are abstraction leaks and giving an explanation for those that are._
_You get 3 points for each explanation of an exception if you correctly identify whether it should be checked and explain why._
