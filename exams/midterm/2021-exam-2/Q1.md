# Question 1: Making things faster [10 points]

You are working on an app which is a search engine for cat photos.
The app works by making requests to a server which stores the photos.
Users search for cat photos and see a batch of results at a time; they can tap on a photo to see it full screen.

You are getting two main complaints from users about the appâ€™s performance:

1. When going from a page of results to the next one, the photos take too long to load
2. When going back to the search results after looking at a picture, the photos take too long to be re-downloaded

For each of these complaints, write exactly one sentence giving a possible solution and explaining why it helps:

1. ???
2. ???

_You get 5 points per solution to each complaint if you give its name and a correct 1-sentence explanation._
