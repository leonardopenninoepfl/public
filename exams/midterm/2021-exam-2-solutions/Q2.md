# Question 2: Making changes [15 points]

Your team is discussing the following code:

```java
/** Uploads images to the cloud. */
public final class ImageUploader {
    public void upload(Image image) { /* … */ }

    private boolean canUpload(Image image) { /* … */ }
}
```

One of your colleagues suggests that `upload` should be changed to return the URL at which the image was uploaded.
Explain in 1 sentence whether this breaks backward compatibility and why or why not (without worrying about whether this is a good or a bad thing):

> This breaks binary compatibility, as existing compiled code refers to the method using a void-returning signature.

Another colleague thinks that `canUpload` should be made public.
Explain in 1 sentence whether this breaks backward compatibility and why or why not (also without worrying about whether this is a good or a bad thing):

> This does not break compatibility, as the method is private so nobody else could call it.

Another colleague points out that `upload` currently has some unexpected behavior regarding file sizes,
and suggests that this should be written down in a Google Doc shared with the team.
Give 1 sentence explaining why this is not a good idea and 1 sentence suggesting a better way to record this information:

> This kind of issue should be documented in the code until it is fixed, not in an unrelated document that may be forgotten or become out of sync.


_You get 5 points for the first two explanations if you correctly identify whether it breaks compatibility and why._
_You get 5 points for the last explanation if you correctly identify why it is a poor idea and propose a better solution._
