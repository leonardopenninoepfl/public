# Step-by-step solutions of Weather app

This folder contains step-by-step solutions to the Weather app. Each sub-folder contains solutions that work
out of the box for the mentionned part (and all previous one):

- [Solution of exercise 0](setup) (to work on exercise 1.1)
- [Solution of exercise 1.1](create-app) (to work on exercise 1.2)
- [Solution of exercise 1.2](add-behaviour) (to work on exercise 2)
- ...

To use these solutions, simply open the corresponding folder in Android Studio and you're good to go! 

:warning: Only use these solutions if you weren't able to complete the previous part(s).

> For example, if you want to work on the second exercise (making the app modular), 
> but weren't able to complete exercise 1: start from the `add-behaviour` solution of exercise 1.2
